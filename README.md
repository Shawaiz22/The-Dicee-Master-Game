The concept of this game very unique which i have taken inspiration from a very famous game i.e, Snake and ladders. But here, instead of snakes, there are Obstacles and
instead of ladders, there are <b> Assets ðŸ’¹. The main interesting part of this game is that I tried to make it very interactive and dynamic ðŸŽ², all the moving
animations, sounds and all the small detailing which i have worked upon, make this game an amazing source of entertainment ðŸŽ® and it engages the user to play it more and
more ðŸ¤©.
